Tweet Analyzer
==============

The aim of this project if to gather and analyze posts from Twitter.com to gain some insights on important topics in the world.
Tweepy library was used to interact with Twitter API

## This project contains of 3 scripts:
- TweetPeeker.py - gathers tweets
- Extractor.py - analyzes the content
- PlotTwister.py - draws statistics plots

### At the moment this project is platform dependent and designed for Linux. Also requires replacing existing Access Tokens.
## How to run:
```
python3 TweetPeeker.py --help  -  shows all available options
python3 Extractor.py --help  -  shows all available options
python3 PlotTwister.py
```

## What I have learned:
- usage of tweepy
- list comprehensions
- OOP in Python
- interactions with json format
- basic usage of matplotlib
- capabilities of Twitter Search API
- & a lot more

Although this project does not contain any difficult algorithms (so far) it became quite complex and time consuming, but also gave me a lot of satisfaction. I am hoping to develop it more in the future, especially the analysis part, to let it create true insights of whats happening in the Internet.
